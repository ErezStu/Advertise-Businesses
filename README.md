# An app of business and simple users, the business users, can advertise businesses, a simple user can only watch them.

I used React, Node JS, MongoDB and Bootstrap.

Download it and type "npm install" on each one library (client and server).


After that in the Server library type: "node app".
in the client library, type "npm start" and choose another address server when it asks you.
