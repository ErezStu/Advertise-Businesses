# An app of business and simple users, the business users, can advertise businesses, a simple user can only watch them.

I used React, Node JS, MongoDB and Bootstrap.

Download it and type "npm install" on each one library (client and server).


after that 
on the Server library type, "node app" on the client, type "npm start" and choose another address server when it asks you.

Enjoy
